# Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_FIFO
The repository contains design for Synchronous and Asynchrounous FIFO 

Asynchronous FIFO :- FIFO stands for First in First Out , It is a digital circuit which is extensively used between two different asynchronous  clock domain crossing where data needs to be transferred . It includes managing data transfer, addressing potential timing differences, and
ensuring data integrity.

Synchronous FIFO :- FIFO stands for First in First Out , It is a digital circuit which is extensively used between two different synchronous  clock domain crossing where data needs to be transferred . It includes managing data transfer, addressing potential timing differences, and
ensuring data integrity.
